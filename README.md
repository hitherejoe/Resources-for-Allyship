# Resources for Allyship

When it comes to inclusivity, the term 'ally' should be treated as a verb. Whilst that is true, it helps to have knowledge about other peoples experiences, history and also how to take action. For that reason, I thought I'd start curating a list of resources that I have read or watched which are based around inclusion / diversity. 

This list will continue to grow and I'll only add things once they have been read or viewed, rather than it just being a list of resources that I am aware of.
